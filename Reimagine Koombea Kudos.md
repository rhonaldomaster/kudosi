🚀 Reimagine Koombea Kudos — Slack Demo Challenge

Hey guys\! 👋  
You may have noticed that our Koombea Kudos App isn’t working properly. Instead of just fixing it internally, HR wants to build the next version together with you.

We’re launching a company-wide contest to redesign the Koombea Kudos experience, with two key requirements:

👉 It must integrate with Slack  
👉 You must present a working demo

## 🎯 The Challenge

Create a new Koombea Kudos solution that works inside Slack and can be shown live or recorded as a demo.

We’re looking for ideas that are:

* 💚 Aligned with Koombea culture  
* 🔔 Slack-first (bots, workflows, commands, automations)  
* 🎉 Simple and meaningful  
* 🛠️ Functional — not just a concept

## 🧪 Demo Requirements

Your submission must include a demo, such as:

* A Slack bot prototype  
* A Slack Workflow  
* A basic app integration  
* A sandbox workspace demo  
* A recorded walkthrough showing the flow end to end

## 🧠 What Should Your Solution Cover?

* Give kudos to one or more people at the same time  
* Include the reason for giving kudos (the why matters)  
* Allow selecting the channel(s) where the kudos will be displayed  
* Show how kudos are delivered (DM, public channel, thread, etc.)  
* Show how the receiver(s) are notified  
* Clearly demonstrate the end-to-end flow in your demo  
* Address at least one pain point of the current Kudos app  
* How kudos are given (commands, buttons, reactions, workflows, etc.)

  **Nice to have**  
* Notifications or reminders   
* Simple summaries or counts (e.g. kudos given/received)  
* Data exportation (Google Sheets or similar)

You can work individually or as a team (team max 3 members).

## 📅 How to Participate

1. Build your Slack-integrated solution  
2. Prepare a short recorded demo  
3. Submit by January 30th  
4. HR \+ leadership will review demos  
5. Winner(s) announced 🎉
